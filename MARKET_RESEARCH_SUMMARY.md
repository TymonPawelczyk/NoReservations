## Recommended Strategy: Differentiation

**Don't compete on:**

- Serious dating features (not our focus)
- Therapy depth (not qualified)

**DO compete on:**
- Fun & playfulness (our strength)
- Couples bonding experience (our niche)
- Seasonal/gift marketing (unique opportunity)
- Cosmetic creativity (pixel art appeal)
- Session-based monetization (unique model)

**Pricing advantage:**
- Lower than dating apps because couples psychology
- Lower than therapy because we're entertainment
- Higher than casual games because premium experience
- Result: $4.99/month "goldilocks" pricing
